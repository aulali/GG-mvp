        %p We're excited you want to join GirlsGuild as an Maker! Your apprenticeship can be event-based, production-based, or ongoing. We'll review and post the apprenticeship once you've completed your listing and submitted the listing payment.
        %p We charge $9 to promote it to the GirlsGuild community, collect applications for you to review, and connect you with an apprentice. We'll also ask your permission to run a background check, as part of our efforts to foster a safe community.
