                  GirlsGuild is a service that offers apprenticeships for girls, by girls. We connect girls and women with artists and makers to build a supportive, collaborative community.

                  There are lots of ways to get involved in GirlsGuild. If you're interested in picking up some new skills and meeting new friends while you're at it, you can take some of our artist-led workshops. If you think you'd like to do an apprenticeship but aren't sure what kind, try a 1-day apprenticeship to get your feet wet and find out what it's all about. And if you're really looking to build your skills and get some real experience working with an artist longer term, apply for a production, event, or ongoing apprenticeship. If you sign up for our newsletter we'll keep you posted on events and new opportunities that come up in the community.

                  It’s really important to us that you feel confident attending and participating in our workshops and apprenticeships. We exist to build a supportive and collaborative community of makers, and we believe the women who get involved are also inspired by this goal. We run background checks on all the makers who offer workshops and apprenticeships, and we encourage any participants or parents with concerns about safety to contact us before the workshop or apprenticeship begins; we’ll do our best to address any questions or issues that arise.

                  In an apprenticeship, a maker works one-on-one with a girl interested in learning the skills of her art. There are a few ways that can look. Some apprenticeships are focused on production, where the apprentice helps the maker produce her work, learning the skills, tools, and process of making by doing them. Other apprenticeships are focused around particular events, such as a gallery show, art auction, or craft fair, where the apprentice helps the maker plan, prepare for, and carry out the event. Still other apprenticeships are simply ongoing opportunities to develop your skills by working alongside and collaborating with the maker. It's about getting real world experience of a maker's work and lifestyle, and building some serious skills in a particular area of making.

                .accordion-inner
                  Apprenticeships typically take place in the maker's studio or workspace. Depending on the kind of apprenticeship, it may also involve visiting event venues, fabrication workshops, or other places.

                .accordion-inner
                  It depends on the focus of the apprenticeship - some apprenticeships might have a fairly short timeframe of just a few weeks to meet relevant deadlines. Others have a longer lead time or are planned as ongoing over the course of a few months or longer.

                  When a maker is available to take on an apprentice, we list her apprenticeship opportunity on our website. You can apply for the apprenticeship, and when she's reviewed all the applications, the maker chooses the girl who'll be the best fit for the work they'll be doing. We'll let you know her decision, and if you're accepted, you confirm by registering and paying.

                  There's a flat fee of $29 for an apprenticeship match. This is charged only after you've been accepted for the apprenticeship and have decided you really want to do it.

                  In a GirlsGuild workshop, an artist or maker offers to teach a particular project or technique to a group of girls, usually in a 2-3 hour session (some workshops have multiple sessions over a few days or weeks). It's a chance to learn from the maker to gain a new skill and make something of your own.

              #q8.accordion-body.collapse
                .accordion-inner
                  Each workshop is different, so costs vary. When a maker offers to lead a workshop, she sets the cost to include the materials and tools that will be used, and to fit the length of the workshop. For most workshops, the sign-up fee covers all the materials you’ll use to make something you’ll bring home with you.

              #q9.accordion-body.collapse
                .accordion-inner
                  As often as possible, workshops take place in the maker’s own studio or workspace - this gives you a chance to see a little bit of what it’s like working in her world. In situations where her workspace just can’t accommodate a workshop, we work with the maker to find an appropriate venue somewhere else in the community.

                    What if I'm signed up and later I can't make the workshop?
              #q4.accordion-body.collapse
                .accordion-inner
                  That's fine. We offer a full refund if you let us know 7 days before the workshop.

      /           In a 1-day apprenticeship, a maker allows 1-4 girls to join her for a few hours in her studio, to give them a glimpse of what her life as an artist is like by showing/demo-ing her tools, her materials, her inspiration and process, and letting the girls try out some small part of it. It's about getting an introduction to the maker's overall practice and the business of her art - that way you'll know if you're interested in learning more about it through workshops or a longer-term apprenticeship.

We'll let her know that you're interested, and she'll suggest a few options for dates/times that could work. You get to choose the day that works for you, and then to confirm it you register and pay.
