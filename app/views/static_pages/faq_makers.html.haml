                  We've tried to keep our framework for apprenticeships broad, so you can offer an apprenticeship that will truly meet your needs. However, we've found that most apprenticeships fall into three main categories; Production, Event, and Ongoing.

                  %h3 Production Apprenticeship
                  If you need help producing a big order or a new line of your work, you might consider taking on a girl to help you as a production apprentice.

                  %h3 Event Apprenticeship
                  If you have an upcoming event you could use a hand with, consider an apprentice to help plan, prepare for, and carry it out.

                  %h3 Ongoing Apprenticeship
                  Or if you're simply interested in new collaborations and the chance to teach your skills and share your process, an ongoing apprenticeship carries a lot of possibilities.

                  Once you know what you'd like in an apprentice, you can let us know by proposing an apprenticeship for us to list on our website. We'll collect applications from interested girls for you to review, and you choose the applicant that seems best suited to work with you.

                  In most cases, the give and take of teaching and working will likely balance out; you teach your process and skills in return for her assistance with your work. However, we leave it up to you to decide whether the level of work you expect your apprentice to do should be paid, or whether you'll be taking on a level of teaching that merits payment. Either way, payment would be a matter between you and the apprentice, and would not be managed by GirlsGuild. If you do plan to pay, or ask for payment, you should explain that in the description of your apprenticeship when you propose it.

                  It's up to you, based on your needs. Some apprenticeships might be as short as a few weeks, but we think the most rewarding will be for a longer period of a few months or more. That way you'll have time to teach your apprentice the skills and techniques she needs, and see her progress in the work she's doing with you.

                .accordion-inner
                  Sure. What we'll do is forward you the applications as we receive them and when you see someone you'd like to interview just let us know what dates you're available to meet up with her. We'll email her to see if she's available and CC you on the email so that you have each other's contact info in case there are any questions about directions, etc.

                .accordion-inner
                  If your apprentice isn't working out for any reason, just let us know and we'd be happy to gently end it early.  We think that being honest and clear about expectations from the apprentice is the best way to find someone who's committed.  And of course it will always be our priority to help out if you have any difficulty along the way.

                .accordion-inner
                  We believe that the maker is the best person to determine the cost of their workshop based on materials, length of the session, and effort. That's why we leave the cost up to you. Sometimes that means it will be too high and you will get fewer registrants, or if it's too low, you may feel like it wasn't quite worth the effort. So to give you some basic guidelines, when we spoke to parents they were comfortable paying between $40-60 for a 2-3 hour workshop. The cost of materials should be included in the cost you set for your workshop. Sometimes the materials can be expensive, so let that show by listing the materials in the class description! Generally, it's up to the maker to source and provide materials (depending on what you plan to teach).

                  We want to make GirlsGuild a viable way to make supplementary income, so we encourage you not to sell yourself short. Even if you'd be happy to teach a workshop for free, we've found that putting a small cost ($5-10 or so) actually gets better attendance - people see it as more valuable, and more of a commitment, when they've paid for it.

                    %li You set the cost - Example: $45.00 per person

                    %li
                      Of that new total cost per person, GirlsGuild takes 16.7%, and the maker takes 83.3%

                  The date/time of the workshop is up to you! It helps to consider your audience; if you're leading a workshop for teens or children, after-school hours or weekends will be best. If you're teaching a workshop for adults, evenings might be a good option. Whatever time you choose, it's always best to schedule the date far enough in advance to give us 4 weeks or more to promote it, and give people a chance to sign up.

                  If you're not quite ready to set a date, we can add the workshop with a pre-register link to let girls sign up to be notified when the date is set.

                  If you need help sourcing enough tools for the workshop, we'll do our best to help. Another suggestion is to put out a request for tools on our Facebook page.

              #q23.accordion-body.collapse
                .accordion-inner
                  We're committed to protecting our artists' style, and we recognize that copying can sometimes feel like it's not the best form of flattery. Which is why we ask everyone who signs up to take a workshop to agree not to replicate the individual styles of our amazing artists, although they should feel free to use the techniques they learn to develop their own style. This is a checkbox that comes right before purchasing the registration. We also make forms available to each artist to hand out at the beginning of the workshop on the same form as the waiver to get that agreement in writing as well.

              #q31.accordion-body.collapse
                .accordion-inner
                  Absolutely!  Though we want to create a space for learning where girls and women feel safe and confident, we also want to be inclusive of everyone who would appreciate this space as well.  We give you the option to specify your workshop or apprenticeship be opened to all gender identities.

        /          Because we know how busy you are - we created a framework for 1-day apprenticeships to give you a low-commitment way to get involved in the GirlsGuild community. When you list on our website as open for 1-day apprenticeship, you don't have to schedule anything until a girl requests it. When you get a request, you suggest a few date/time options for a 3-4 hour apprenticeship session, and the girl chooses the option that works for her.

        /          When a girl visits your studio on the agreed day, you show her your workspace, tools, and materials, explain and demonstrate some of your process, let her try it, and most importantly, talk with her about why she's interested in it. This is different from a workshop where you're teaching a specific project or technique; a 1-day apprenticeship should give an overview of your practice as a whole.
