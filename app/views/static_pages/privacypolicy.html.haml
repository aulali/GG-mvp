        What Personal Information Does GirlsGuild Collect?
      %p
        The information we gather from users enables us to provide, personalize and improve our services, and allows our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to personalize their experience on the Website and our service and interact with other users through the site. In connection with the Website, we request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of the Website, which allows users to identify one another. We collect the following types of information from our users:
      %h3
        Personal Information You Provide to Us:
      %p
        When you create an account on our service, we require you to enter your birthdate in order to verify that you are not a child as defined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. If you are a child, we require you to have your parent create an account on your behalf and manage your use of the Website and our service. To create an account we ask you to provide your first and last name, email address, and choose a password.
      %p
        Once your account is created, we send an email to the provided email address prompting you to confirm your account. In addition, if you elect to participate in any paid features of our service, we may collect additional billing information such as a mailing address. As only an adult (18 years of age or older) can enter into any transaction or subscription with respect to such paid features, if a minor wishes to participate in these features we ask them to obtain parental permission, and require that they provide their parent’s name and email in order to do so.
      %p
        GirlsGuild does not intentionally collect any personal information from children. However, as part of the functionality of our service, we allow accounts created by minors to upload certain content to the site, including photos. We take measures to prevent minors from communicating personal information through these features, but we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of these measures. If you use these features to disclose personally identifiable information, you should be aware that such information could be read, collected, or used by other users and/or third parties. You agree not to provide any personally identifiable information through these features, and we are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you provide using these features.
      %p
        You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to create an account or take advantage of many of the Website’s special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as obtaining account confirmation as set forth above, answering questions, improving the content of the Website, responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, attribution for content you submit, customizing the advertising and content you see, allowing you to communicate with other users, and communicating with you about GirlsGuild’s products and services, including specials and new features.

This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Website or services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, GirlsGuild never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
