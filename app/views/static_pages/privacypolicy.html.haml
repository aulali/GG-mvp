        %strong What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
      %p This Privacy Policy covers GirlsGuild’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that GirlsGuild gathers when you access the Website and when you use GirlsGuild’s services.  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that GirlsGuild does not own or control (including any third-party products or services used for logging into the Website or that are integrated with the Website), or to individuals that GirlsGuild does not employ or manage.

        %strong What Personal Information Does GirlsGuild Collect?
      %p The information we gather from users enables us to provide, personalize and improve our services, and allows our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to personalize their experience on the Website and interact with other users through the site. In connection with the Website, we request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of the Website, which allows users to identify one another.  We collect the following types of information from our users:
      %p
        %em Personal Information You Provide to Us:
      %p
        When a child creates an account on our service, their account starts out as a private account which is invisible to the public and other users of our service.  We require parental consent prior to making a child’s account publicly visible.  During the account creation process, we require a child to enter a parental email address for purposes of obtaining this consent.  In addition to this parental email address, we also receive and store the following information when a child creates an account:
        %em
          We ask the child to pick a cartoon animal “avatar” which will represent them on the service;
        We ask the child to pick a nickname to identify them on the service.  We encourage children to use our nickname generator, and we ask that children do not use their real name.
        * We ask the child to provide a password.
      %p We do not condition a child’s participation in an online activity on the child providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.  Once the child’s account is created, we send an email to the provided parental email address prompting the parent to create a parental account on our service, which is linked to the child’s account.  During the parental account registration process, we receive and store the following information: full name of the parent, parent’s email address, a password for the parental account, as well as any other information necessary for us to provide our services.  In addition, if a parent elects to subscribe to any paid features of our service, we may collect additional billing information such as a mailing address.
      %p If we do not receive a response from a parent following creation of a child account, we delete the parental email address from our database.  Once a parent has completed the parental account registration process, we unlock the child’s account to be publicly visible.
      %p GirlsGuild does not intentionally collect any personal information from children other than the information set out above.  However, as part of the functionality of our service, we allow child accounts to upload certain content to the site, including photos and comments.   We take measures to prevent children from communicating personal information through these features, but we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of these measures.  If you use these features to disclose personally identifiable information, you should be aware that such information could be read, collected, or used by other users and/or third parties.  You agree not to provide any personally identifiable information through these features, and we are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you provide using these features.
      %p
        You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to create an account or take advantage of many of the Website’s special features.  The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as obtaining parental consent as set forth above, providing parents with notice of our privacy practices, answering questions, improving the content of the Website, responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, attribution for content you submit, customizing the advertising and content you see, allowing you to communicate with other users, and communicating with you about GirlsGuild’s products and services, including specials and new features.

        %em Personal Information Collected Automatically:
      %ul
        %li We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services.  GirlsGuild automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, browser information, operating system, timestamps, the pages you request, and the actions and path you take on the Website.
        %li Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and how they use its various components.  GirlsGuild only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services.  As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Website or services.  We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, GirlsGuild never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

We use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve quality.
        %li
          %p Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.

For example, we may allow an advertiser to target an ad to you based on your query history.
      %p Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them.

      %p User profiles: User profile information including users’ name, email address, and other information you enter (“User Submissions”) may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Website. Email addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User Submissions. Users’ email addresses will not be directly revealed to other users by GirlsGuild, except, when the user is “connected” to another user via a shared group membership, or an invitation, or if the user has chosen to include their email address in their User Profile.
      %p Communication in response to User Submissions: As part of the Website and services, you will receive from GirlsGuild email and other communication relating to your User Submissions. You acknowledge and agree that by posting such User Submissions, GirlsGuild may send you email and other communication that it determines in its sole discretion relate to your User Submissions.
      %p Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.  In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of GirlsGuild or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
      %p Protection of GirlsGuild and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the any applicable law, regulation or other legal requirement; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of GirlsGuild, our employees, our users, or others.
