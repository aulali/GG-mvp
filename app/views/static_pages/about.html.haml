          Melissa is a business owner and newly minted interaction designer. Inspired by the power of design from a brief era living in Copenhagen, she traded her political hat in Oregon for a design hat in Texas. In both cases, her focus is engaging and mobilizing people. Despite growing up with Aunt Jemima in the south, she eats her waffles gluten free and covered in nuts & berries.

      %h1 Our Story
      %br
      %p We are Diana and Cheyenne, the co-founders of GirlsGuild, and we originally met two years ago as students at the Austin Center for Design. The program there teaches the design process, and applies it to building business ideas that address a social problem.

      %p The two of us spent 3 months researching and interviewing teenage girls about some of the issues they face in building a sense of identity and a voice in their community. Two things we learned were that learning and developing tangible skills (broadly speaking, the skills of making), as well as finding a sense of place in a community, are both key to coping with those issues.

      %p Bringing together the ideas of learning skills and being part of a community, over the next few months we came up with the idea for GirlsGuild as a community of makers focused on sharing skills through apprenticeship.

      %p So, once we had the idea, it was time to figure out a business model around it. We're a mission-driven business (sometimes called a for-benefit business), which means that we are a self-sustaining, but if/when we make a profit (we haven't yet! :-P), it goes back into the business to further the social mission.

      %p We graduated last May and have been working on building GirlsGuild as a business since then - testing out different models for workshops and apprenticeships to find a balance that is beneficial to both makers and girls learning from them. We're definitely still figuring out what works best!
