          Diana is an interaction and communication designer, former ESL teacher and tutor. She has lived in four countries on three continents, and loves the challenges of learning and sharing across languages and cultures. Originally from Vancouver, Canada, now she's practicing replacing her “eh’s” and “aboot’s” with “y’all’s”, but she still eats her waffles with pure maple syrup.

          Melissa is a business owner and newly minted interaction designer. Inspired by the power of design from a brief era living in Copenhagen, she traded her political hat in Oregon for a design hat in Texas. In both cases, her focus is engaging and mobilizing people. Despite growing up with Aunt Jemima in the south, she eats her waffles gluten free and covered in nuts & berries.
