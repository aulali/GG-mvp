- When not signed in as a user & trying to view Apprenticeships page: 

	NoMethodError in ApprenticeshipsController#index

	undefined method `apprenticeships' for nil:NilClass

	app/controllers/apprenticeships_controller.rb:8:in `index'



- Why use f.label? What if I want the label to be different?


- No placeholder or helper text with taggable fields - Any workarounds?


- How to add another host? (I know this is a wormhole.)
